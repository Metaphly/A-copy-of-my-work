  <body class="cross">
    <div id="content">
    <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
    <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1 px darkgrey border corners of an 8 px radius.</p>
    <p>Other elements can have borders too, like <span class="red-border">this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing border color;<br>
    all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, <span class ="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>
    That prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
    <div class = "red-border">This div has a red border</div>
    <div class = "blue-border">This div has a blue border</div>
    <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
    <div class = "red-border top-round">This div has a red border, and 8px round top corners</div>
    <div class = "blue-border bottom-round">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
  </body>
